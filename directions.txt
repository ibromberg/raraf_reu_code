1. Set up geometry; set environment to air.
	a. Create a volume of water that is 10cm thick x 1m x 1m centered 50cm below the tungsten target.
2. Set up physics to work with both photons and electrons.
	b. Set the cut off energy for both to be 1keV.
3. Verify electrons from the source are eveny distributed across the area (review print110 output).
4. Start with 50keV=0.05MeV electrons from the source, find the spectrum of photons going though the top surface of the water phantom.
	a. Tally and plot this energy spectrum, either by taking the data out of the output file (easier) or using the MCNP plotting functions
     (relatively harder, I haven't done this personally but I know this is done commonly)
	b. Be sure to have enough energy bins, at minimum one every 1keV.
	
5. Change to instead use 100keV=0.1MeV electrons. Plot energy spectrum again.
6. Insert a 1mm thick piece of aluminum just below the tungsten target. Plot the energy spectrum in the water phantom again.
7. Add an additional 0.5mm of copper just below the aluminum. Plot the energy spectrum in the water phantom again.

8. Instead of using a simple surface tally, create a mesh tally at that same position, our goal is to see the 2 dimensional field size and shape.
	a. Use the tmesh tally (type 3), create a mesh 1cm thick at 50cm from the Tungsten. 
	b. Figure out how you want to plot this data. If you want to extract it to plot in matlab, look into using the "gridconv" feature.
		i. if you can figure out how to plot this with the MCNP plot command that would be awesome but not necessary.

9. Feel free to start looking into the surface source write (SSW) and surface source read (SSR) functions which can be really helpful.
